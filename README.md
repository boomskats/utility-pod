# Nextflow Tracer Use-Case Example

This repository provides an example of using Nextflow with a tracking tool called Tracer. The workflow consists of three main files: `main2.nf`, `index.nf`, and `quantpe.nf`. The key workflow file is `main2.nf`.

## Overview

The workflow performs the following steps:
1. Initializes the Tracer tool.
2. Executes the INDEX process to prepare the transcriptome.
3. Executes the QUANTIFICATION process to quantify the paired-end reads.
4. Terminates the Tracer tool.

The user can run the entire workflow by typing `nextflow run main2.nf`.

## Files

- `main2.nf`: The main workflow script.
- `index.nf`: Contains the INDEX process definition.
- `quantpe.nf`: Contains the QUANTIFICATION process definition.

## Requirements

- Nextflow: Ensure you have Nextflow installed. Follow the instructions on the [Nextflow website](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) to install it.
- Tracer: The tracking tool used in this workflow. Ensure Tracer is properly set up in your environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    

2. Prepare your input data:
    - Ensure your reads are placed in the `data/ggal/` directory and named `gut_1.fq` and `gut_2.fq`.
    - Ensure your transcriptome reference is placed in the `data/ggal/` directory and named `ref1.fa`.

3. Run the workflow:

    bash
    nextflow run main2.nf

## Workflow Details

### main2.nf

This file contains the main workflow definition:

groovy
nextflow.enable.dsl=2

params.reads = "$projectDir/data/ggal/gut_{1,2}.fq"
params.transcriptome = "$projectDir/data/ggal/ref1.fa"

// Include the INDEX process
include { INDEX } from './index.nf'

// Include the QUANTIFICATION process
include { QUANTIFICATION } from './quantpe.nf'

workflow {
    // Create a channel from the reads
    read_pairs_ch = Channel.fromFilePairs(params.reads, checkIfExists: true)

    // Run the INDEX process
    index_ch = INDEX(params.transcriptome)

    // Run the QUANTIFICATION process
    quant_ch = QUANTIFICATION(index_ch, read_pairs_ch)
}


### index.nf

Defines the INDEX process that builds an index from the transcriptome reference:

groovy

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

/*
 * Define the INDEX process
 */
process INDEX {
    input:
    path transcriptome

    output:
    path 'salmon_index'

    script:
    """
    tracer start
    tracer tool index v1
    salmon index --threads ${task.cpus} -t ${transcriptome} -i salmon_index
    """
}

### quantpe.nf

Defines the QUANTIFICATION process that quantifies the paired-end reads using the index:

groovy

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

/*
 * Define the QUANTIFICATION process
 */
process QUANTIFICATION {
    input:
    path salmon_index
    tuple val(sample_id), path(reads)

    output:
    path "$sample_id"

    script:
    """
    tracer tool quant v2
    salmon quant --threads ${task.cpus} --libType=U -i ${salmon_index} -1 ${reads[0]} -2 ${reads[1]} -o ${sample_id}
    tracer end
    """
}

## Tracer Integration

Tracer is integrated into the workflow to track the execution and versions of the processes. The workflow initiates Tracer at the beginning and terminates it at the end. Ensure that Tracer commands are appropriately inserted in your processes if necessary.
